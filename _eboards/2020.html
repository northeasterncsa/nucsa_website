       Hey y'all! I'm Claire and I'm a middler from the greater metropolitan area of NYC. On the weekends, if we're not drowning in classwork, my roommates and I will often hermit in our apartment and watch Netflix or YouTube, play switch, or clown on each other. Otherwise, I'll be watching anime or kdramas, painting a new face on myself, or torturing my friends with meme music.

       When I'm not home, you can often find me eating, fueling my caffeine addiction, or out and about within the Asian American Community. If you have any questions (even in regards to schoolwork/engineering/coop - I was a TA and a tutor, so I have some experience with that!), or just want someone to chat with, feel free to send me a message or talk to me at one of our GMs. I am also LGBTQIA+, so please know you have a safe space with me!

       Hi All! I'm Josh and I'm excited to be Vice President for the upcoming school year! I love to play and watch sports, and I'm always watching anime, sitcoms, kdramas, you name it. I like to dance and sing but I'm trash at both, but ultimately I'm always looking to have a fun time with others! Super excited to meet you all at our GMs and events, and I can't wait to see what this year has in store for us! :)

       Hi, I'm excited to be your Treasurer this year! I like eating/making food, going on food adventures, watching Netflix & movies, sleeping in, exploring with friends, listening to music, going to concerts, and traveling. If you also like to do any of these things then come talk to me :) I love meeting new people, and I am so excited to see what this year is going to bring!

       Hello! My name's Elaine and I'm a 3rd year from New York (no, not the city). When I'm not holed up in Ryder, you can find me editing blursed videos, playing the ukulele, trying to do Chopped with the remains of my fridge/pantry, or in the snack aisle of an Asian grocery store. Feel free to message me if you want to check out the newsletter, get bubble tea, or share Switch friend codes!

       On my free time, I like to volunteer, draw with pencils or pastel, eat copious amounts of food, and geek out over science/healthcare stuff. I’m applying to med school in the coming year, so if you see me in a nervous breakdown, that’s why. I’m always down to hang out (once the pandemic is over) and get a bite to eat! Hit me up for poor life advice or a food adventure.

       Hello friends! My name is Anthony and I'm a second year Computer Science major from just outside Chicago. When I'm not procrastinating with my friends on Summoner's Rift, you can find me out on my bike, eating out with my buds, or chilling in the best location in Boston, Snell Library. I've also been trying to get into cooking recently so if you have any tips or beginner recipes please let me know!

       Hi! My name is Connie and I'm a second year CS and Math major from southeastern Connecticut. I'm really excited to be Program Coordinator for this year, where I'll be in charge of the family system and small outings/activities :D Outside of CSA, you can find me eating, getting boba, watching TikToks (lmao), spending time with friends, or shopping for clothes that I'll never wear. I also really like soccer, but I haven't played seriously since coming to college. Lmk if you ever want to hang out, and I can't wait to see what this year holds!

       Hi y'all! I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina and I enjoy photography, cooking (and eating), EDM, and biking. Some fun facts are that I have an odd number of teeth and I once fractured my wrist kicking a football :)

       What's up! My name is Michael Huang, and I'm CSA's PAAC Rep for the 2020-2021 school year! I'm from central Jersey (yeah it's real), and I'm currently a sophomore studying the best major on earth :'( Some of my hobbies include playing basketball and ping pong, hitting the gym, dancing, and getting tilted playing video games. Around campus, you can catch me suffering in Snell, hanging out in Curry, or running from building to building trying to get to CSA meetings on time! I’m super excited to be this year’s PAAC Rep and meet all of you! See you at the next GM!

       Norman is a Bostonian at his core. He's currently a fourth-year at Northeastern University. He enjoys designing, watching movies, playing videos games, and trying his best. He would like a dog, but probably doesn't have the money or ability to care for one yet. All he needs is love, attention, and some food for proper use.
