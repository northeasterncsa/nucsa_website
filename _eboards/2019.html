       Hi! My name is Lily and I'm a 4th year business major, concentrating in supply chain management and minoring in communication studies. When I'm out and about you're most likely to find me at Matthew's (I'm on the club skating team here), searching for new places to eat, or hanging out with friends. This will be my fourth year serving on CSAâ€™s e-board, so if you have any questions feel free to reach out!

       Hello hello! Welcome to Northeastern and welcome to CSA! My name is Sean and I hope to meet you. A little bit about myself; I am from rural Westford, Massachusetts. I have a lot of hobbies including viola, foreign languages, food, photography, exercise and outdoor adventuring. A cool thing about me is that I am Burmese Chinese. My family is Chinese but started living in Myanmar from around the 1890's. Ever since then my family has spread to Taiwan, Singapore and the US. I have grown up in several cultures and have many stories to share about each of them! Speaking of food, one of my favorites is Burmese salad. It is a hand mix of vegetables, noodles and spices from the regions of Myanmar. I do enjoy eating pasta as well and sometimes I'll make a curry pasta fusion. Please reach out to me if you need someone to hang out with or anything else!

       My name is William, but please call me Will! I grew up in Queens, New York my entire life. In terms of stuff I like to do, I really enjoy trying new things whether it be new activities or new foods. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the ambiguity and thrill that comes with doing something completely unfamiliar. As a major foodie, I'm always down for a food hangout or just a chat about new foods. Currently, I love Yume Ga Arukara in Boston, but I'm welcome to any new suggestions!

       Henlo all! I'm a Mass native in my second year here. When I'm not holed up in my room studying or sprinkling memes into our newsletter, you can find me power napping or being a potato. In my free time, I enjoy planning my life around finding and eating good food, shopping but not buying anything, playing indie video games, having "eclectic" taste, and whiling my life away on the internet. Feel free to message or talk to me if you want to be potatoes together :))

       Henlo, I'm Claire and I'm from NYC suburbs. I'm a second year ChemE, with a minor in Chinese, and I went on dialogue to Kunming this past summer. On the weekends, if we're not drowning in classwork, my roommates and I will often watch Netflix, youtube, or play switch (I'm terrible at Mario Kart but I still love it). Otherwise, I'll watch anime or torture my friends with various meme music. When I'm out of my apartment, you can often find me eating or fueling my caffeine addiction >:) As your programs coordinator for the year, I'll be in charge of the family system and our various outings/activities. If you have any questions, or just want someone to chat with, feel free to send me a message or talk to me at one of our GMs!

When I'm not studying, working or procrastinating, I'm usually chilling with friends, listening to music, going on spontaneous adventures, cooking, eating, or sleeping.

I look forward to meeting everyone and feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or you just want to hang out!

I'm from New York (not the city), and on campus I'm most likely working on a project in Ryder or trying my hardest not to buy all the pastries in a Chinatown bakery. You can usually find me playing the ukulele, learning to cook, or at open badminton sessions. I'm excited to get to know everyone this upcoming year!

In my free time, you can find me eating, getting bubble tea, watching TikToks (lol), spending time with friends, or shopping for clothes that I'll never wear.

       What's up! My name is Michael, I'm a freshman computer science major, and currently serving as CSA's own Freshman Representative! I also from the great state of New Jersey, so if you have any thoughts about the existence of 'central jersey', I'd be happy to inform you that it is, in fact, a real place. Other than berating people about where I live, I enjoy dancing, cooking, playing basketball and table tennis, and being baby. When I'm not suffering through my coursework in Snell, you can find me in Curry, Rebecca's, and at CSA's GM's and events! I'm super excited for this year and I can't wait to meet you all :)!
